        <hr>
        <p>Hii, I was born in Bihar But grew up here in Delhi. Being a Delhiite, I learned so many things. Primarily, I did my education from a nearby school i.e. Surya Public School which helped me to get my foundation too clear. This was the place where I participated in too many competitions. I also took part in the National Election Commission Quiz Competition where I represented my school. 
            further I did my 12th (PCM) from a Public School after that I admitted into Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University to pursue B tech in IIOT. 
            
            I read novels, playing badminton as well as cricket in my leisure time.</p>

            <h3>SMART ATTENDENCE SYSTEM</h3>
            <br>
          <p>The Smart Attendance System, developed by us, is an advanced solution that incorporates NodeMCU, an LCD display, an RFID scanner, and RFID tags to revolutionize attendance tracking. As employees scan their RFID tags with the RFID scanner, NodeMCU processes the data and displays attendance information in real time on the LCD display. The scanned data is seamlessly uploaded to our custom-designed Smart Attendance System app, granting immediate access to attendance records and valuable analytics. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive data management, the system simultaneously integrates the information into Google Excel sheets. This seamless integration of hardware and software empowers organizations to efficiently manage attendance, optimize resources, and make data-driven decisions.</p>
